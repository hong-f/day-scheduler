## My process
I first played around with the existing code to understand how things were connected to one another. with that, I started organizing and psueodo coding what I would need to create this page. I saw that I needed to build out the skeleton of the scheuduler based on time block + floppy disc save button. In the JS, I had to create functions to display the current date, save data into the local storage when the user saves input, and have the time blocks color coded based on whether its for the past, present, future. I did not need to touch the exsiting CSS provided in this homework.
